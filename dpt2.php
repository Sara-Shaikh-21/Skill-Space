            <p class="section-description"><br><br>Your sales staff builds relationships with your customers. Further, a quality salesperson helps identify a customer’s unique needs and makes sure that those needs are met. Since salespeople have direct contact with your customers on an ongoing basis, they become privy to personal information that helps make sales interactions smoother and friendlier. A highly trained sales professional tailors sales pitches to the individual customer and learns the ins and outs of their needs.Sales team is responsible for retaining customers, a monumentally important task. It costs a business five- to-25 times more money to attract new customers than it does to keep existing customers. Research further shows that upping your customer retention rate by only 5 percent can result in increased profits of 25-to-95 percent for your business. It makes sense always to keep your customers happy. This is where your sales team comes in. As the direct point-of-contact for your business, your sales department is building valuable relationships with customers. A sales team that follows up with customers and makes sure they are happy with the product or service you are providing is crucial. Most customers who take their business elsewhere do so quietly, without informing anyone. So one objective of a sales staff is to make sure customers remain happy and continue to do business with your company.</p>
