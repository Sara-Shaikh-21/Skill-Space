      <p>The employees feel more engaged in diverse working environments,
          diversity increases the employee retention rates while on the other hand 
          reduces sickness absence, the talent attractiveness tends to improve and
          companies with diversity in the workplace manage to leverage better services 
          and customer experiences.<br>
          Ways to Embrace Diversity for Workplace Success:- <br>
      </p>
      <li>Learn to think like an intrapreneur: <br>
      Intrapreneurship, or disrupting internal processes or cultural norms, is at its 
          heart about innovation. One group of innovators in particular figured out how 
          to advance their industry through the way they approach challenges – these are 
          open-source software engineers, and they use design thinking. It’s a good example of
          what intrepreneurship can be: pick a diverse team with a range of experiences and 
          perspectives; make your mistakes early and be open about them. Without the diverse
          and constant input, these engineers would be less successful in the way they solve
          challenges. When faced with a difficult task or situation, seek out advice from new 
          and diverse sources, most likely you will find an improved approach.  </li>
      
      <li>Discover new places to network: <br>
      As collaboration with diverse individuals provides new points of view, networking
          accomplishes this on a larger scale. By going to events for closely related
          professions, or simply connecting through social media channels such as Twitter or
          LinkedIn where you can virtually engage in conversations with anyone, you put 
          yourself in a position for growth. Inside your organization you can join or 
          organize a powerful employee network with a diverse set of peers. While inte
          racting with your network, look for, accept and appreciate differences. Fric
          tion leads to heat, and our heat makes the atoms move faster!
      </li>
      
      <li>Focus on the strengths everybody brings to the table: <br>
      he more opinions, the more variety, and the more diversity we bring to the table the
          more we can unchain our creativity, which is hidden in every one of us.People with
          different communication abilities, for instance, can be diverse. Autistic people 
          are known for thriving in repetitive tasks, which is an especially valuable
          skill set in today’s data-driven work environments. These skills help
          uncover insights into customer behavior and business trends, and can lead to
          discoveries that alter how a company operates. In the future of work, diversity 
          will not be an option, but an imperative to sustain in our global, fast paced 
          economy, where never just one person owns and knows the truth.
      </li>
      
      <li>Stand up to discrimination:<br>
      Stand up if you see or experience discrimination. Raise your voice for the unheard 
          opinion. Help others appreciate how every person has a different strength and 
          realize that in that strength there is opportunity to grow and be more productive. <br>
          The need for new perspectives becomes especially important when we examine the 
          future workplace. As our world gets smaller, diversity doesn’t only mean differences
          in gender and race, but age and geography as well. Our world has become
          ultra-connected – successful companies find that to harmonize these connections
          relates directly to how fast they innovate. The implications are key for our 
          global workforce because innovation thrives when we are faced with the unfamiliar.
          Diversity is what makes business more sustainable.

  <div class="dropdown-container" style="height:auto;">
      <p>The leader must demonstrate this commitment and passion in every meeting, 
          presentation, and in how they handle customer problems. The leader's behavi
          or must inspire employees to act in the same way.Communication, integrity, 
          inclusion, and sensitivity to the needs of the employees round out the qual
          ities and characteristics of an inspirational leader. No one is inspired
          by a leader who people think does not care about them. 
         The inspirational leader feels passionate about the vision and mission
          of the organization. The nature of the vision and mission is critical
          for enabling others to feel as if their work has a purpose and meaning beyond
          the tasks they perform each day. Sometimes leaders must help their staff 
          connect the dots by explaining this big picture to all. Communicating the big p
          icture regularly will help reinforce the reason your organization exists.<br>
      Traits of inspiring personality:</p>
      
     <li> They Have Immense Courage:<br>
      People who inspire us to be better are not weak, scared or stuck.  
         They’re bold and have the fortitude and courage to push through their fe
         ars, and take a stand on what they believe. They’ve done what I call “b
         rave up” – honing the 10 ways to develop the bravery required to become
         positive, strong, and influential in the world today. These inspirers 
         have faced great odds and challenges, and they’ve turned “their mess into 
         a message” to help others overcome their challenges too. They’re warriors, 
         and courageous fighters for what they believe in and how they see themselves and 
         the world. They've figured out that if you want to make a difference in the wo
         rld, you have to address your own demons first.</li>
      
      <li> Has Deep Empathy For Others:<br>
      The one  who inspire us to be better are fully capable of experiencing empathy,
          and they openly express their ability to understand our personal “stories” 
          and who we really are and what we feel, deep down.  They don’t coddle or ove
          rprotect us, but they validate and appreciate who we are inside, which mak
          es us feel safe to be more authentic, and expand on our own identity eve
          n more fully, without worrying that we’ll be crushed or humiliated in the process. </li>
      
      <li>Express Love And Appreciation Openly, And Foster Equality:<br>
      The people who inspire us the most are not full of hate, bigotry,
          or racism and they don’t harbor or encourage thoughts of who is “better”
          than someone else, or who deserves more.  They model equality. They 
          are full of love and appreciation, and aren’t afraid to share it
          openly at work, at home and in their communities.  They use loving, 
          accepting language, and are inclusive not divisive, and share their
          thoughts and beliefs around love, acceptance and equality in their 
          narratives. Love and acceptance is at the basis of what they do. L
          ook at those who’ve made the biggest positive difference througho
          ut history. Invariably, there is love, understanding, compassion, 
          and appreciation at that heart of who they are and what they stand for</li>
      
      <li> Are Emotionally Healthy And Healed:<br>
      There’s a powerful expression, “ Hurt people hurt people.” Truer
          words have never been spoken. If you’re hurt, wounded, distraught, 
          overly-reactive, or emotionally dysfunctional in any way, you’re 
          just not in a position to make the positive impact you long to, 
          or to inspire people at the highest level. Why? Because your
          open wounds get in the way -- of how you see yourself and others, 
          and how you relate, experience and interact with the world. The wo
          unds you experience color everything.
      </li>
      
      <li>Believe In Collective Power:<br>
      Those who inspire others believe in collective power – in
          uplifting others (and not just a select few) so that 
          positive change can happen more quickly. They’re not
          focused intensively and solely on amassing their own wealth, power
          and influence. They want to see others rise, grow, and expand.
          That’s what fuels them and motivates their actions, and their
          business and growth strategies. In doing so, they can become
          very wealthy, powerful and influential, but that’s only a 
          by-product of their focusing on expanding collective strength,
          power and positive impact.
      </li>
      
      <li>Have Used All Of Themselves To Make A Difference:<br>
      These inspirers have grown comfortable being totally authentic and 
          open about who they really are deep down (warts and all). They 
          no longer worry that they’ll be rejected, scorned and put down.
          They’ve grown beyond feeling they have to hide or suppress parts
          of themselves to be accepted. They realize that it’s the univer
          sal plight to want to hide those parts of us that make us feel
          ashamed and vulnerable. And it’s that very readiness to use all of 
          themselves - openly and courageously - that inspires and encourages
          us to do the same.</li>
