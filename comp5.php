    <section id= digitalmarketing>
    <div class="que-row">
  <div class="column">
    <div class="card" style="margin-left:70px;">
        
        <h3><b>Digital Marketing </b></h3>
        <button class="dropdown-btn" >Read About Digital Marketing !
           <i class="bi bi-chevron-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
  <div class="dropdown-container" style="height:auto;">
      <p>Digital marketing is the act of selling products and services 
          through channels such as social media, SEO, email, and mobile apps.
            Several ways of digital marketing...
      </p>
      <li>Video: <br>
      Video is taking the internet by storm and this isn’t about to stop.
    Videos have the potential to hold customer’s attention on 
    retail sites for two minutes longer than average (which is really like a lifetime in
    the digital world) and a well-optimized video can boost your chances of being in a top
    Google ranking position by at least 50. In addition, more than 80% of customers are more
    likely to purchase a product after seeing it detailed in a video.   </li>
      
      <li>SEO & SEM:
      Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is key to all levels of digital marketing and as such,
          anyone going into the field must have at least a basic handle on it.Both SEO and
          Search Engine Marketing (SEM) inform your entire digital strategy on both a 
          data and content level, and you need to be able to communicate to other teammates 
          about this, so you just won’t get far if you don’t make a point of learning the basics.
      </li>
      
      <li>Content Marketing:
      Content is the core of digital marketing and content marketing will continue to be a crucial
          part of the game no matter what happens. But content marketing is a huge job in itself.
          You have to be able to understand how to not only create high quality, SEO-friendly
          content of various sorts, you also have to understand how to effectively get
          audiences to engage.And to make things a little more challenging, it’s important to
          note that content can take many forms, from video to social, emails, web content,
          blogs, e-books, videos, whitepapers…the list goes on. 
      </li>
      
      <li>Data / Analytics:
      No matter what facet of digital marketing you are going into, Google Analytics
          will probably be central to your strategy. Monitoring and reporting via such
          tools is pretty straightforward, but the tricky part is how to gather and use that 
          information to help you learn more about consumer behaviour and apply it to new 
          solutions that boost traffic and conversions.
          <br>Most businesses (even small ones) have huge amounts of data to track,
          and great digital marketers need to understand how to gather and use this to their
          advantage. Most companies will always be looking for people who to only know 
          how to “read” this data, but to know exactly which data to use towards improving 
          business strategy in the future. If you can show that you can do this in 
          innovative ways and that the way you do it ends with important results, you’re 
          going to be a valuable asset in the industry.
      </li>
      
      <li>Understand Design-Based Thinking & Planning:
      According to The Interaction Design Foundation, there are 5 key phases to this process:
          empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. The reason why this works so 
          well in the digital marketing sphere is that so much of it is (or should be) centred
          on the user experience. Another interesting thing about this approach is that it
          can be used in a non-linear way – so that in some instances you may get to the
          testing phase and then come back to the middle phase, for instance, to re-consider
          ideas.<br>
          Designers and developers are likely to use an approach like this, so even if
          you’re not one, it’s a good idea to at least have a solid understanding of it and apply
          it when feasible.</li>
      
      
      <li>Be Tech Savvy:
      Because the industry is really technology driven, you have to have a decent grip
          on technology as well as be able to learn it quickly. If you’re millennial-age 
          or younger, this is probably going to be second-nature, but older generations may want
          to put a bit of elbow grease into teaching themselves not only specific
          technologies but also just getting familiar with the most commonly used software
          and tools in their focus area.
          <br>Generally, if you understand the basics of web coding, as well as having a
          clear idea of how to use the basic Content Management (CMS) systems like WordPress,
          you’re likely well on your way to landing that dream job.</li>

   <section id= hr>
    <div class="que-row">
  <div class="column">
    <div class="card" style="margin-left:70px;">
        <h3><b>HR </b></h3>
        
         <button class="dropdown-btn" >Read About HR!
           <i class="bi bi-chevron-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
  <div class="dropdown-container" style="height:auto;">
      <p>Human resources is the set of people who make up the workforce of an organization,
          business sector, industry, or economy. A narrower concept is human capital, the
          knowledge and skills which the individuals command. They serve as the link
          between an organization's management and its employees.<br>
      The seven HR basics: </p>
      
     <li> Recruitment & selection:<br>
      Recruiting candidates and selecting the best ones to come and work for the company 
         is a key HR responsibility. People are the lifeblood of the organization and 
         finding the best fits is a key task.</li>
      
      <li> Performance management:<br>
      Performance management is the second HR basic. It involves 
          helping people to become their best selves at work, boosting the company’s
          bottom line. </li>
      
      <li>Learning & development:<br>
      Learning and development helps employees to reskill and upskill. Learning &
          Development (L&D) is led by HR and good policies can be very helpful in 
          advancing the organization towards its long-term goals.</li>
      
      <li>Succession planning:<br>
      Succession planning is the process of planning contingencies in case of key employees
          leaving the company. If, for example, a crucial senior manager quits his/her 
          job, having a replacement ready will guarantee continuity and can save the
          company significant money.</li>
      
      <li>Compensation and benefits:<br>
      Compensation comprises primary compensation and secondary compensation.
          Primary compensation involves directly paid money for work, which often is
          a monthly salary and sometimes performance-based pay.
      </li>
      
      <li>Human Resources Information Systems:<br>
      The last two HR basics are not HR practices but tools to do HR better. The first 
          is the Human Resource Information System, or HRIS. An HRIS supports all the
          cornerstones we discussed above. For example, for recruitment and selection, 
          HR professionals often use an Applicant Tracking System, or ATS, to keep track 
          of applicants and hires.</li>
      
      <li>HR data and analytics:<br>
      The HR fundamentals revolves around data and analytics. In the last half-decade, 
          HR has made a major leap towards becoming more data-driven.

The Human Resource Information Systems we just discussed is essentially a data-entry system. 
          The data in these systems can be used to make better and more informed decisions</li>

  <div class="column">
    <div class="card" style="margin-left:70px;">
        <h3><b>IT </b></h3>
        
        <button class="dropdown-btn">Read About IT!
           <i class="bi bi-chevron-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
  <div class="dropdown-container" style="height:auto">
      <p>Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every
          business plan. From multi-national corporations who maintain mainframe
          systems and databases to small businesses that own a single computer, IT plays 
          a role. <br></p>
      <li>Communication Between Employees, Suppliers and Customers:<br>
      Email was one of the early drivers of the Internet, providing a simple and inexpensive
          means to communicate. Over the years, a number of other communications tools
          have also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat systems, 
          online meeting tools and video-conferencing systems. Voice over internet protocol
          (VOIP) telephones and smart-phones offer even more high-tech ways for employees
          to communicate</li>
      
      <li>Inventory Management Systems:<br>
       Inventory management systems track the quantity of each item a company maintains,
          triggering an order of additional stock when the quantities fall below a pre-determined
          amount. These systems are best used when the inventory management system is
          connected to the point-of-sale (POS) system. The POS system ensures that 
          each time an item is sold, one of that item is removed from the inventory
          count, creating a closed information loop between all departments</li>
      
      <li>Data Management Systems:<br>
      Companies are able to store and maintain a tremendous amount of historical data
          economically, and employees benefit from immediate access to the documents 
          they need.</li>
      
      <li>Customer Relationship Management:<br>
      Companies are using IT to improve the way they design and manage customer relationships. 
          Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems capture every interaction a company 
          has with a customer, so that a more enriching experience is possible. If a c
          ustomer calls a call center with an issue, the customer support representative 
          will be able to see what the customer has purchased, view shipping information
          , call up the training manual for that item and effectively respond to the issue.
<br>The entire interaction is stored in the CRM system, ready to be recalled if the customer
          calls again. The customer has a better, more focused experience and the company 
          benefits from improved productivity.</li>

           <i class="bi bi-chevron-down" style="float: right;"></i></button>
  <div class="dropdown-container" style="height:auto;">
      <p> The techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into
          mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human c
          onsumption. Data analytics help a business optimize its performance.
          Analysis of data is a vital part of running a successful business. When data
          is used effectively, it leads to better understanding of a business’s previous perf
          ormance and better decision-making for its future activities. There are man
          y ways that data can be utilized, at all levels of a company’s operations<br>
      Types of Data Analytics:<br></p>
      
      <li>Descriptive Analysis:<br>
      Descriptive analysis answers the “what happened” by summarizing past data, usually in the form of dashboards.

The biggest use of descriptive analysis in business is to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs describe how a business is performing based on chosen benchmarks.</li>
      
      <li>Diagnostic Analysis: <br>
      Diagnostic analysis takes the insights found from descriptive analytics and drills down to find the causes of those outcomes. Organizations make use of this type of analytics as it creates more connections between data and identifies patterns of behavior.</li>
      
      <li>Predictive Analysis: <br>
      This type of analysis is another step up from the descriptive and diagnostic analyses. Predictive analysis uses the data we have summarized to make logical predictions of the outcomes of events. This analysis relies on statistical modeling, which requires added technology and manpower to forecast. It is also important to understand that forecasting is only an estimate; the accuracy of predictions relies on quality and detailed data.</li>
      
      <li>Prescriptive Analysis: <br>
       Prescriptive analysis is the frontier of data analysis, combining the insight from all previous analyses to determine the course of action to take in a current problem or decision.
<br>Prescriptive analysis utilizes state of the art technology and data practices. It is a huge organizational commitment and companies must be sure that they are ready and willing to put forth the effort and resources.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a perfect example of prescriptive analytics. AI systems consume a large amount of data to continuously learn and use this information to make informed decisions.</li>
